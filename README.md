This was the project for Modern Control course. By obtaining the formula of the model through different papers, we had to:
1. Linearize the model
2. Simulate and make a comparison between the nonlinear and linear models
3. Analyze different types of stability
4. Design a state feedback controller and a full-order observer and integral control feedback
5. Simulate different types of Feedbacks and observers.

There is also a 27-page report in Persian language.
