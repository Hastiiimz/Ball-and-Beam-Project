This was the project for Modern Control course. By obtaining the formula of the model through different papers, we had to:
1. Linearize the model
2. Simulate and Make a comparison between both the nonlinear and linearized models
3. Analyze Stability
4. Design a state feedback controller and a full-order observer and integral control feedback
5. Simulate different type of Feedbacks and Observers
There is also a 27-page report in Persian language.
